Description: STARSEQ is an R-package for detecting associations with
        rare variants using selected samples in sequence-based
        association studies. It corrects for the bias in the secondary
        trait distribution induced by selective sampling on the primary
        trait. The corrected secondary trait can be analyzed by
        standard rare variant tests. In the STARSEQ package, several
        popular rare variant tests were implemented, which include 1.)
        combined multivariate and collapsing 2.) weighted sum
        statistics, 3.) kernel based adaptive cluster, 4.) variable
        threshold test 5.) sequence kernel association test.
